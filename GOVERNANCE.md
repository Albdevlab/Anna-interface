# Governance Alignment

ANNA is delivered as a Qubic ecosystem service
through milestone-based governance approval.

The project is designed to align with Qubic’s principles:
- Incremental delivery
- Risk minimization
- Transparency
- Verifiable progress

---

## Governance Model

- Funding is requested per milestone
- Each milestone delivers independent value
- Governance may approve, pause, or stop funding at any stage
- No protocol-level changes are introduced by this project

---

## Scope Control

This proposal explicitly excludes:
- Consensus or protocol modifications
- Economic activation (burn, fees)
- AGI core logic or Aigarth intelligence development

Any such changes require a separate proposal and governance approval.

---

## Milestone Validation

Each milestone is evaluated based on predefined acceptance criteria
published in the repository.

Acceptance of a milestone authorizes progression
to the next funded phase.

---

## Transparency

- All progress is tracked publicly in this repository
- Documentation is updated per milestone
- Deliverables are verifiable by governance and the community

---

## Long-Term Positioning

ANNA is positioned as a long-term ecosystem interface.
Future expansions remain subject to separate governance processes
and are not implied by this proposal.
