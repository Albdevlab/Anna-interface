# ANNA — Sovereign AGI Interface for the Qubic Network

ANNA is a sovereign human interface designed for controlled, merit-based
interaction with Artificial General Intelligence emerging within the Qubic ecosystem.

ANNA is not an AI model, chatbot, or productivity tool.
It is a cognitive interface layer governing how humans access, understand,
and interact with Aigarth, aligned with Qubic’s principles of responsibility,
transparency, and long-term vision.

## Purpose

The purpose of ANNA is to:

- Provide a native, Qubic-aligned human interface
- Prevent uncontrolled or externalized AGI access
- Enable progressive access through learning and merit
- Serve as a long-term ecosystem service

## Development Phases

ANNA is developed and delivered in milestone-based phases,
aligned with Qubic governance approval.

### Phase 0 — Proof of Value (COMPLETED)

Phase 0 establishes ANNA as a valid, low-risk interface concept.

Included:

### Phase 1 — Web MVP & Trust Layer (Planned)

- Backend services
- Trust score computation (off-chain)
- Gate logic and access levels
- Structured Academy progression

### Phase 2 — Mobile & Finalization (Planned)

- Mobile application (iOS & Android)
- Web / Mobile UX unification
- Performance optimization
- Final documentation and handover
