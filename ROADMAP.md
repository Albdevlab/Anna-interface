# ANNA — Project Roadmap

ANNA is developed using a **phase-based, governance-first approach**.  
Each phase delivers independent value and requires explicit validation
before progressing to the next stage.

This roadmap communicates **vision and sequencing**, not binding commitments.

---

## Phase 0 — Proof of Value (Completed)

Phase 0 establishes ANNA as a valid, low-risk interface concept
aligned with Qubic governance principles.

### Focus
- Architecture and system definition
- Scope and non-goals clarification
- Governance alignment
- Conceptual UI and interaction model

### Delivered
- Architecture documentation
- Phase scope definition
- Acceptance criteria
- Demo and verification notes
- Public repository with complete Phase 0 documentation

### Governance Status
- No protocol changes
- No economic mechanisms
- No AGI or intelligence execution
- **Phase 0 completed and ready for governance review**

---

## Phase 1 — Web MVP & Trust Layer (Planned)

Phase 1 represents the first **implementation phase**, following
governance validation of Phase 0.

### Focus
- Functional Web MVP
- Controlled access via Trust and Gate logic
- Off-chain services with full reversibility

### Objectives
- Deliver a usable web-based ANNA interface
- Introduce backend services for interaction
- Aggregate Trust signals off-chain
- Enforce access control through Gate logic
- Implement structured Academy progression
- Integrate with Qubic RPC in read-only mode

### Governance Positioning
- Fully off-chain
- No protocol or consensus changes
- No economic mechanisms
- No AGI or intelligence execution

### Status
- **Documented only**
- Implementation requires explicit governance approval

---

## Phase 2 — Mobile Interface & Finalization (Indicative)

Phase 2 represents a **potential future phase**
focused on extending ANNA to mobile platforms
and consolidating the user experience.

### Indicative Focus
- Mobile application delivery (iOS & Android)
- Web and mobile UX unification
- Interface refinement and stabilization
- Final documentation and handover

### Governance Notes
- Phase 2 is **indicative only**
- Not approved by this roadmap
- No scope, cost, or timeline is committed
- Requires a separate governance proposal
- Defined only after Phase 1 validation

---

## Governance Principles

Across all phases, ANNA adheres to the following principles:

- Incremental delivery
- Clear scope boundaries
- Reversible implementation
- No implicit commitments
- Governance-first decision making

Each phase may be:
- Approved
- Modified
- Paused
- Rejected

without impacting previously delivered phases.

## Roadmap Disclaimer

This roadmap:
- Communicates intent and sequencing
- Does not represent a binding contract
- Does not imply automatic progression
- Is subject to governance oversight at every stage

---

## Summary

- **Phase 0:** Proof of Value — completed  
- **Phase 1:** Web MVP & Trust Layer — documented, pending approval  
- **Phase 2:** Mobile & Finalization — indicative vision only
