# ANNA Architecture Overview

ANNA is a sovereign human interface layer designed for the Qubic ecosystem.
It acts as a controlled gateway between humans and emerging intelligence,
without introducing protocol-level dependencies.

---

## Design Principles

- No protocol or consensus changes
- Read-only on-chain access in early phases
- Progressive access through learning and merit
- Non-emotional, state-based user interface
- Governance-first, low-risk architecture

---

## High-Level Components

### Web Interface
- Desktop-first interface
- Displays system state via Pulse UI
- Handles wallet connection and user flow

### Mobile Interface (Future Phase)
- iOS and Android applications
- UX aligned with web interface
- Delivered in a later milestone

### Backend Services
- Handles application logic
- Manages Trust and Gate rules (off-chain)
- Interfaces with Qubic RPC

### Qubic RPC Integration
- Read-only access to on-chain data
- Wallet verification and basic activity signals
- No transaction signing in early phases

### Trust & Gate Logic
- Off-chain trust scoring
- Access levels determined by merit and learning
- Designed to evolve without breaking compatibility

## Architecture Scope

This architecture supports:
- Phase-based delivery
- Independent evaluation per milestone
- Future expansion without rework

Protocol-level changes and economic mechanisms
are intentionally excluded from this phase.
