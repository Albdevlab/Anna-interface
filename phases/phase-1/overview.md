# Phase 1 — Web MVP & Trust Layer (Overview)

Phase 1 represents the first implementation stage of ANNA,
following governance validation of Phase 0.

This phase focuses on delivering a functional Web MVP
with controlled access based on trust and learning signals.

---

## Objectives

- Deliver a functional web-based ANNA interface
- Introduce backend services required for interaction
- Implement off-chain Trust signal computation
- Enforce access control through Gate logic
- Preserve governance control and reversibility

---

## Governance Positioning

Phase 1 will:
- Remain fully off-chain
- Introduce no protocol or consensus changes
- Activate no economic mechanisms
- Execute no AGI or intelligence logic

All implementation remains reversible and subject to review.
