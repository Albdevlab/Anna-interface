# Phase 0 — Scope

This document defines the exact scope of Phase 0
to ensure clear expectations and minimal governance risk.

---

## In Scope (Included)

Phase 0 includes the following elements:

- Public web-based ANNA interface (desktop)
- Wallet connection via Qubic RPC (read-only)
- Display of basic wallet information
- Pulse-based system state visualization
- Introductory Academy / learning content
- Public documentation and repository structure

---

## Out of Scope (Excluded)

Phase 0 explicitly excludes:

- Transaction signing or asset transfers
- Any economic mechanisms (burn, fees, rewards)
- Trust score enforcement or hard access gating
- Mobile applications
- Backend services beyond read-only access
- AGI logic or Aigarth intelligence execution
- Protocol, consensus, or network changes

---

## Scope Rationale

The limited scope of Phase 0 is intentional:

- Minimize technical and governance risk
- Enable fast evaluation by governance
- Provide visible progress without long-term commitment

Any expansion beyond this scope
requires explicit approval through a new milestone or proposal.
