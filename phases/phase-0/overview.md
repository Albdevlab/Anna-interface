# Phase 0 — Proof of Value

Phase 0 establishes ANNA as a valid, Qubic-aligned interface concept.
Its purpose is to deliver a visible, testable foundation
with zero protocol or economic risk.

---

## Objectives

- Provide a public web-based interface for ANNA
- Demonstrate wallet-based access using Qubic RPC (read-only)
- Communicate system state via a Pulse-based UI
- Introduce users to the ANNA / Aigarth vision through learning content
- Establish documentation and governance alignment

---

## Non-Goals

Phase 0 explicitly does NOT include:
- Transaction signing or asset movement
- Economic mechanisms (burn, fees, rewards)
- AGI logic or intelligence execution
- Protocol or consensus interaction

---

## Expected Outcome

At the end of Phase 0:
- ANNA is publicly accessible
- Governance can verify real progress
- The project is ready for evaluation and potential continuation
